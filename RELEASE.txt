Escher CMS Release Notes

================================================================================

Release 1.0.1

There has been a minor adjustment to the default location of the main Spark/Plug
directory. As a result, the "sparkplug_dir" config parameter has changed.

If you are using a custom installation layout you may need to adjust the value
of this parameter in the following config files:

	config/admin-config.php
	config/install-config.php
	config/publish-config.php

If you are using the standard installation layout, the new versions of the above
files have already been adjusted for you.
